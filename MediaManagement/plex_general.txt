Verify you have the en_US locale
Verify you have the libc6 2.19 if you want to use the latest Plex Media Server
Make sure you have libexpat1 installed
Make sure you are using the right repository – must be jessie if you want the latest and greatest
Move the transcoding folder to your external hard drive
Do not use WiFi if you want the best results
Stick to Method 1 for installation
Force Plex to attempt transcoding – by default PMS blocks transcoding for ARMv7 servers
Avoid using Plex.tv to connect as it can override the force transcoding, only use your local IP address or dynamic DNS address
Monitor Plex Media Server and restart it automatically with this guide.
Do not use Plex.tv instead use Dynamic DNS and a reverse proxy with this guide.
