# control-scripts
A small repo of important scripts I've written, primarily to operate on Raspbian (Debian).

PublicIP:
	Small command utilizing sed to yield public IP.

reboot_wifi.sh:
	Restart wlan0, sshd, minidlna (others?) if wlan0 iface is down.
	This is a problem because the ISP I currently have drops periodically.

service_start.sh:
	In-progress script to start several important programs on boot.
